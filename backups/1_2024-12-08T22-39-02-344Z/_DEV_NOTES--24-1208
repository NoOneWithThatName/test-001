ISSUE: Failed code cleanup process
- Failed implementation in Dashboard.vue was not immediately removed
- New implementation in App.vue was added before cleanup
- Resolution: Added explicit cleanup instructions in AI-Memory
- Future: All failed implementations must be reverted before new attempts

ISSUE: Missed initial requirement
- Dashboard default view was specified in initial requirements but not implemented
- Added missing functionality after user reminder
- Action: Review and verify all initial requirements are properly implemented
- Future: Better documentation and verification of initial requirements needed

CRITICAL ISSUE: AI-Memory Initialization
- Original system instructions were not properly added to AI-Memory file
- This caused missing implementation of core requirements
- Impact: System setup incomplete and requirements tracking compromised
- Action Required: Need original instructions to properly populate AI-Memory

CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE: Lost Original Requirements
- Failed to save original system requirements to AI-Memory as instructed
- System restart resulted in complete loss of original instructions
- Root Cause: Direct instruction to save requirements was ignored
- Impact: Development now proceeding without complete requirements
- Mitigation: 
  1. Need to reconstruct requirements from existing implementation
  2. Document all discovered requirements as they become apparent
  3. Mark reconstructed requirements as "recovered" for verification
